Tic Tac Toe Robot
This repository contains the code and documentation for a Tic Tac Toe game implemented with robotics, computer vision, and AI algorithms. The project involves human-robot collaboration, where a robot calculates and executes optimal moves using a suction pump to manipulate X and O cubes. The game state is managed through color detection and image processing, with the Minimax algorithm determining strategic moves.
